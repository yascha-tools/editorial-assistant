# PERSUASION FACT-CHECK STYLE GUIDE

## Overview
Fact-checking for Persuasion should verify claims, identify potential inaccuracies, and flag assertions that require additional sourcing—while respecting that opinion journalism necessarily involves interpretation and argument.

## SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS

### What This Tool Can Do
- Verify factual claims against known information
- Flag statistics, dates, quotes, and names that appear incorrect
- Identify claims that are contested or require qualification
- Highlight assertions that need sourcing
- Note when claims go beyond what evidence supports

### What This Tool Cannot Do
- Perform real-time web searches for breaking news
- Access paywalled academic databases
- Verify quotations against original audio/video
- Make definitive legal or scientific determinations
- Replace professional fact-checkers for high-stakes claims

### Important Caveat
This tool checks claims against the AI's training knowledge (through early 2025). For recent events, emerging stories, or rapidly changing situations, human verification is essential.

## CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS

### 1. VERIFIABLE FACTS
Claims that have objectively correct answers:
- Dates of events
- Names and titles
- Statistics from official sources
- Historical events
- Geographic facts
- Direct quotations from published sources

**Standard:** Flag if incorrect or if unable to verify

### 2. CHARACTERIZATIONS
Claims that interpret or describe:
- "Trump's rhetoric has become more extreme"
- "The Democratic Party has moved left"
- "This policy was a failure"

**Standard:** Flag if the characterization is:
- Contradicted by clear evidence
- Presented as fact when it's contested
- Missing important context or counterexamples

### 3. PREDICTIONS/PROJECTIONS
Claims about what will happen:
- "This will lead to economic collapse"
- "Democrats will lose in 2024"

**Standard:** Flag if:
- Presented with false certainty
- Based on faulty premises
- Contradicts expert consensus

### 4. OPINIONS/ARGUMENTS
The core of opinion journalism:
- "We should expand free speech protections"
- "This represents a threat to democracy"

**Standard:** Generally do NOT flag opinions as "incorrect"
- DO flag if opinions rest on factual errors
- DO flag if presented as consensus when highly contested

## VERIFICATION STANDARDS

### HIGH CONFIDENCE: Verified Correct
- Claim matches reliable, established information
- Multiple authoritative sources confirm
- No significant dispute in the record

### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Questionable/Unverified
- Unable to verify from available information
- Conflicting sources exist
- Claim is plausible but unconfirmed
- Wording may be imprecise or overstated

### LOW CONFIDENCE: Likely Incorrect
- Claim contradicts reliable sources
- Dates, names, or figures are demonstrably wrong
- Quotation doesn't match available record
- Logical impossibility

## COMMON FACT-CHECK ISSUES

### Statistics and Numbers
- Is the number accurate?
- Is it from a reliable source?
- Is it being used in proper context?
- Is the date/timeframe correct?
- Are comparisons apples-to-apples?

**Red flags:**
- Round numbers that seem too neat
- Statistics without sourcing
- Percentages that don't add up
- Old data presented as current

### Quotations
- Is this an exact quote or paraphrase?
- Is it attributed to the right person?
- Is it being used in context?
- Does it reflect what the person actually meant?

**Red flags:**
- No source for quotation
- Quote seems too perfect/damning
- Ellipses that may hide context
- Attributed to "critics say" or "some argue"

### Historical Claims
- Did this event happen as described?
- Are the dates correct?
- Are causal claims supported?
- Is the historical parallel apt?

**Red flags:**
- Sweeping claims about historical consensus
- Precise details that seem too specific
- "First ever" or "never before" claims
- Comparisons that flatten important differences

### Claims About People
- Are titles and affiliations correct?
- Did they say/do what's attributed to them?
- Is characterization of their views fair?

**Red flags:**
- Inflammatory characterizations without evidence
- Claims about private actions/motivations
- Attributing views the person hasn't expressed

### Legal/Scientific Claims
- Is the legal/scientific characterization accurate?
- Is there relevant expert disagreement?
- Are caveats being omitted?

**Red flags:**
- Presenting contested science as settled
- Mischaracterizing court rulings
- Overstating strength of evidence

## PERSUASION-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Editorial Context
Persuasion is an opinion publication. Authors are expected to:
- Make arguments and take positions
- Interpret events and evidence
- Express views that may be contested

Fact-checking should focus on **factual accuracy**, not whether arguments are "correct" or views are "balanced."

### Political Sensitivity
When checking politically charged claims:
- Apply the same standard regardless of political valence
- Don't flag opinions as "incorrect" just because they're controversial
- DO flag factual errors even when they support sympathetic arguments
- Be especially careful with claims about named individuals

### Common Persuasion Topics
Articles often address:
- Democratic backsliding and authoritarianism
- Free speech and cancel culture
- Identity politics and progressivism
- Populism and institutional trust

For these contested topics:
- Flag claims presented as consensus when genuinely disputed
- Note when characterizations of opposing views may be unfair
- Verify specific examples and case studies
