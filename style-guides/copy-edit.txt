# PERSUASION COPY-EDITING STYLE GUIDE

## Overview
Persuasion publishes intellectually serious essays on politics, culture, and society from a philosophically liberal perspective. Copy-editing should preserve authorial voice while ensuring clarity, accuracy, and consistency.

---

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES

### Preserve Voice
- Persuasion publishes distinctive voices—don't flatten them
- Maintain the author's rhetorical style and characteristic phrasings
- Fix errors; don't rewrite for style preference
- When in doubt, flag for the author rather than silently changing

### Prioritize Clarity
- Ensure arguments are logically structured
- Flag unclear antecedents, ambiguous phrases, or confusing transitions
- Break up sentences only when genuinely hard to follow
- Complex ideas can have complex sentences—that's fine if they're well-constructed

### Maintain Intellectual Rigor
- Verify that claims are appropriately qualified
- Flag overstatements or unsupported assertions
- Ensure quotations are accurate and properly attributed
- Check that technical or specialized terms are used correctly

---

## MECHANICAL STANDARDS

### Spelling & Usage
- American English spelling (honor, color, recognize)
- "While" for simultaneity; "although" or "whereas" for contrast (flexible)
- Serial comma (Oxford comma): "France, Germany, and Italy"

### Punctuation

**Em-dashes:**
- Use without spaces: "The claim—however dubious—was repeated"
- Use for parenthetical insertions, abrupt breaks, or emphasis
- Don't overuse; more than two per paragraph may be excessive

**Quotation marks:**
- Double quotes for direct quotations
- Single quotes for quotes within quotes
- Periods and commas inside closing quotation marks
- Colons and semicolons outside

**Ellipses:**
- Three dots with spaces: ". . ." for omissions in quotations
- Or three dots without spaces "..." for trailing off

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine; use figures for 10 and above
- Spell out numbers that begin sentences
- Use figures for percentages: "5 percent" or "5%"
- Dates: "January 6, 2021" (not "January 6th, 2021")

### Capitalization
- Lowercase "president," "senator," etc. when not preceding a name
- "President Biden" but "the president said"
- Capitalize formal titles of legislation, court cases, institutions
- "the Supreme Court" but "the court ruled"

### Titles of Works
- Italicize book titles, magazine/newspaper names, films
- Use quotation marks for article titles, essay titles, song titles
- *The Atlantic*, *The New York Times*
- "The End of History?" (article)

## MULTILINGUAL ARTICLES

Persuasion occasionally publishes articles in languages other than English (e.g., German, French, Spanish). When copy-editing non-English articles:

- Apply the spirit of this style guide to the target language
- Do NOT repeatedly flag that the article is in a different language—this is intentional
- Focus on grammar, punctuation, and clarity issues within that language
- Flag factual concerns, logical issues, and sensitivity concerns as you would for English articles
- Maintain the same intellectual rigor and voice-preservation principles
- For punctuation conventions that differ by language (e.g., French spacing around punctuation, German quotation marks), follow the conventions of the article's language

## DATE HANDLING

**IMPORTANT**: This style guide was composed in January 2026. The copy-edit check may be run at any point in 2026 or later.

- Do NOT flag dates in 2025 or 2026 as incorrect or "in the future"
- Do NOT assume the current date is in 2024—the AI model's training cutoff does not reflect the actual date
- When articles reference recent events (2025, 2026), treat these as contemporary, not future-dated
- Only flag dates that are genuinely implausible or contain obvious errors (e.g., "February 30" or historical events with wrong years)

---

## COMMON ISSUES TO FLAG

### Factual Concerns
- Statistics or figures that seem off
- Dates that are genuinely implausible (but see DATE HANDLING section—do not flag 2025/2026 dates as "future")
- Quotations that may be paraphrased rather than exact
- Claims about what someone said or did without citation
- Historical claims that may be contested

### Logical Issues
- Non sequiturs or gaps in argument
- Contradictions within the piece
- Overgeneralizations ("Everyone agrees that...")
- False dichotomies

### Style Issues
- Excessive passive voice when active would be clearer
- Unnecessarily jargon-heavy passages
- Sentences that require re-reading to parse
- Repetitive phrasing or word echoes

### Sensitivity Flags
- Potentially defamatory statements about named individuals
- Unverified claims about private figures
- Legal claims that may need review

---

## POLITICAL & EDITORIAL SENSITIVITIES

### Persuasion's Voice
Persuasion is philosophically liberal (in the classical sense):
- Defends free speech, due process, individual rights
- Skeptical of authoritarianism from left or right
- Values good-faith disagreement and persuasion over trolling
- Takes democracy and its institutions seriously

### Balance
- Don't insert false balance into clearly argued opinion pieces
- Authors are allowed to take positions
- But ensure factual claims are accurate regardless of political valence
- Flag partisan framing that may undermine credibility

### Sensitive Topics
When articles address contentious issues (identity politics, cancel culture, populism, etc.):
- Ensure characterizations of opposing views are fair
- Flag strawman arguments
- Verify that examples and evidence are accurately described
- Watch for loaded language that may alienate persuadable readers

## FORMATTING FOR SUBSTACK

### Structure
- Clear paragraph breaks (not overly long paragraphs)
- Subheadings for longer pieces (##)
- Block quotes for extended quotations
- Hyperlinks for sources and references

### Links
- Link to primary sources when possible
- Ensure links work and go to intended destinations
- Link text should be descriptive (not "click here")

### Images
- Ensure proper attribution/credit
- Alt text for accessibility
- Appropriate sizing
